You're being pursued. You find yourself an excellent hiding place in a bush or perhaps a small bungalow. Your pursuant furtively creeps towards your location and suddenly cries out: 

>*Warmest regards - I've got a lovely piece of cuttlefish for you.*

At this point it is imperative that you resist the temptation to stand up and wave.

You might like to distract yourself with one or more of the following activities:
- Working through all of the major scales in your head, marvelling at the number of sharps in the key of Fâ™¯
- Ask yourself (not out loud) just how much wood a woodchuck could chuck (if a woodchuck could chuck wood)
- Imagine how unfortunate it would be if you tripped on a cobweb and fell into a trunk
