Dutch oven bread is far easier to make than you might imagine. There is no kneading required! The only impediment you might encounter is that you need an oven dish with a lid that can withstand temperatures of 220°C.

With a tiny amount of planning and very little effort - you can make a lovely loaf like this:

## Equipment
- 2¾ Quart Dutch Oven *(Just a round or oval oven dish with a lid...)*

## Ingredients
- 3 cups (450g) all-purpose flour
- 2 tsp active dry yeast
- 1½ tsp sea salt
- 1½ cups (350ml) warm water

## Preparation
- Combine the flour, yeast and salt in a large bowl and stir to combine
- Add the water and mix until the dough forms a ball
- Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and (optionally) a damp tea towel
- Let the dough sit covered at room temperature for 18-24 hours

## Cooking
- Place the Dutch oven dish (with lid on) in the oven and pre-heat to 220°C
- While the oven is heating, transfer the dough from the bowl onto a floured surface
- Form the dough into a ball, adding a few more TBS of flour if needed. *Nb it is a very wet mix and the dough won't form into a nice round ball, it will remain loose and floppy*
- Carefully remove the hot dish, sprinkle a little flour on the bottom (to prevent sticking) and drop/scrape the dough into the dish
- Replace the lid and bake for 30 minutes
- Remove the lid and bake for a further 15 mins or until the loaf is golden brown
